"Classifying Brain Tumors Using CNN" aims to develop a robust and accurate system for automatically detecting and categorizing brain tumors from medical imaging data. With the advent of deep learning techniques, particularly CNNs, the field of medical image analysis has witnessed significant advancements in the detection and diagnosis of various diseases, including brain tumors.

This project leverages CNNs, a type of deep neural network specifically designed for processing structured grid-like data such as images. By training the CNN on a large dataset of brain tumor images, the model learns to automatically extract relevant features and patterns indicative of different tumor types and their characteristics.


Key components of the project include:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathering a diverse dataset of brain tumor images from medical imaging repositories. Preprocessing steps such as normalization, resizing, and augmentation are applied to enhance the quality and diversity of the data.

Model Architecture Design: Designing an appropriate CNN architecture tailored for brain tumor classification. This involves selecting the number of layers, their types (e.g., convolutional, pooling), and tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance.

Training and Validation: Training the CNN model on the labeled dataset using techniques like backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent. Validation is performed using a separate portion of the dataset to assess the model's performance and generalization ability.

Evaluation and Testing: Evaluating the trained model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, the model is tested on unseen data to evaluate its real-world applicability and robustness.

Deployment and Integration: Integrating the trained model into a user-friendly application or system that can be utilized by medical professionals for assisting in the diagnosis and treatment planning of brain tumors. This may involve developing a web-based interface or integrating the model into existing medical imaging software.

By leveraging the power of CNNs and deep learning, "Classifying Brain Tumors Using CNN" aims to contribute towards the development of accurate, efficient, and automated systems for diagnosing and managing brain tumors, ultimately improving patient outcomes and healthcare delivery.
